First of all take bowl
Then pour coco powder and sugar into the bowl then mix it for a while
Then add water to it and while adding water keep on mixing the mixture of coco powder and sugar 
Then add baking powder to the batter
Keep on mixing the batter until in it become thick and make sure there are no lumps in the batter
Then prepare a bowl in which we will bake the cake 
To make sure that the batter does not stick on the bowl we will grease it with melted butter and if you don't have butter you can also use cooking oil for greasing
Then we will pour batter into the bowl
And then we will leave it for a while and we also have to pre heat the oven fo 1 min
Then we will place the batter into the oven , set the temprature to 180 degrees and set the timer for 30 min
After 30 min your cake will be ready let it cool for a while then take out the cake from the bowl place it on plate
 You can also use chocolate syrup for icing its optional
 And then you know what you have to do...
